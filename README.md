# 🔐 Encryption Algorithm Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to **classify encrypted data** based on the encryption algorithm used.  
It automates the detection process, helping in **cryptanalysis, digital forensics, and network security monitoring**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects which encryption algorithm is used from ciphertext samples.  
- Preprocessing pipeline with encoding, balancing (SMOTE), and feature engineering.  
- Trained and tested with multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:  
  👉 [Sentences Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfekadu/sentences/data)  

- Due to GitHub’s file size limit, the dataset is **not included in this repository**.  

Preprocessing steps include:
  - Encoding categorical labels  
  - Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
  - Feature scaling/normalization
